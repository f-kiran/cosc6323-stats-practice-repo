# STATISTICAL METHODS IN RESEARCH

The course covers [statistical methods](https://cpl.uh.edu/index.php/courses/29-statistical-methods-in-research) in human and technology studies or experiments. The course starts with a contrast of hypothesis-driven research supported by statistical inference versus rigorous deduction based on first principles; this is in order to delineate the current from the past mode of science and motivate the subject. Then, it proceeds in a step-wise manner building the student’s background in the statistical tools of the trade. The course culminates the last two weeks with a connection of sound research methods to sound researchers’ attitudes, by delving into the teachings of stoic philosophy.
